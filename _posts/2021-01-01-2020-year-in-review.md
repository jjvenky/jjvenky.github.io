We count years a variety of ways:

* the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) that most of us use for life (and taxes( but not for work or school
* school year that runs [here](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/list/calendar/holidaye.html) September to June (or August if you count the summer break)
* school year that runs two or three terms long from September onwards (September to December, January to April, May to August)
* hydrologic years starting at freeze-up so the snow that falls in one year is included in the water budget in the same year
* hydrologic years starting mid-summer so the year starts and ends with baseflow conditions
* Government [fiscal year](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/annual-financial-report/2019/report.html) that runs from April 1st to March 31st
* government grants from [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/Reports-Rapports/Index_eng.asp) that also follow a year from April 1st to March 31st
* annual report of activities (the effort report) at my university for the work we do from May 1st to April 30st (due on May 5th) so it covers the traditional fall and winter terms of a two-term university system

Sometimes a variety of academic data have to be cut up and repackaged for many of those years for:

* a traditional CV
* the awful [CCV](https://ccv-cvc.ca/indexresearcher-eng.frm)
* the [Form 100](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/onlineservices-servicesenligne/instructions/100/100_eng.asp)
* the institution-specific CV
* the annual report of activities with novel subsections in a docx file

So for *2020 Year in Review*

* up to 200 citations/year largely based on our [novel model for cyanobacteria bloom formation](https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12334) that focused on ferrous iron as the key determining factor of phytoplankton composition (published in February 2014) and our [review and analysis of internal phosphorus loading in Canadian fresh waters](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0500)
