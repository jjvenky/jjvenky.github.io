As previously announced on [twitter](https://twitter.com/JJVenky/status/1205314108880539648), I have been granted tenure and promotion at Laurier.

So why not collate all the things that went into the tenure and prommotion application, i.e., a summary of the last 5Â½ years:

* 14 per-reviewed papers (>20 unique coauthors)
* 9 papers in review (some rejected and resubmitted, some accepted)
* 18 undergrad courses taught (1 reading course)
* 4 grad courses taught
* 3 PDF, 6 MSc, 5 BSc students supervised or co-supervised
* variety of committee work that is difficult to enumerate

It takes a lot of people to be successful.

Thanks everyone.
