No time like the present to learn how to deply jekyll and github pages.

While the new faculty pages at Laurier [look nice](http://wlu.ca/faculty-profiles/arts/jason-venkiteswaran.html) and seem to scale well across platforms, they can't be edited directly by faculty. Whoever thought that was a useful feature? So why not learn how to use jekyll and github pages?

[Code snippets](https://rpubs.com/jasonvenkiteswaran/136237) seem nice too:

{% highlight r %}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(1,1) + labs(x = expression("NO"[3]^-{}*" (mgN/L)"),
                  y = expression(δ^{15}*"N-NO"[3]^-{}*" (‰ vs air)"))
{% endhighlight %}
