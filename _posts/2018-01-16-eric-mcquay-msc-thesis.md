Congratulations to Eric McQuay on finishing his MSc thesis on [The Role of Nitrate in Controlling Iron Release from Sediment during Anoxia in Dimictic, Fresh Water Lakes](http://hdl.handle.net/10012/12867).

His thesis focused on several embayments of [Georgian Bay](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Sturgeon+Bay/@45.5919332,-80.4818165,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4d2bf719b19d0627:0xdf8e902bc904bcde!8m2!3d45.6249572!4d-80.4142624) that often have harmful algal blooms in the summer. His work builds on our understanding of the redox preconditions required for cyanobacteria dominance of phytoplankton blooms. Some of our collaborative work with Lewis Molot at York has recently been published, doi:[10.1139/cjfas-2016-0377](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0377).

He was based in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Waterloo and cosupervised by me.
