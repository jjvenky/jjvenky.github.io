A new pan-Canadian research program to train undergrad students in nutrient biogeochemistry is underway. Dubbed [lugnuts](https://biogeochem.github.io/lugnuts/), it starts with the role of freeze-thaw cycles to nutrient release from soils and vegetation.

Interested upper-year undergrad students should contact me.
