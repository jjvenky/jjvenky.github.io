Deposited two new preprints related to nitrogen isotopes:

* [Towards a global interpretation of dual nitrate isotopes in natural waters](https://eartharxiv.org/czt8p/)
	* This is an ideas paper about how we ought to use and interpret nitrate isotopes (δ^15^N and δ^18^O) in streams and rivers. It's a collaboration with new colleagues that grew out of an [IAEA Coordinated Research Project](https://www.iaea.org/projects/crp/f32007) and our frustration with the persistently poor and naive interpretaton of nitrate isotope data.
	
* [Quantifying the Fate of Wastewater Nitrogen Discharged to a Canadian River](https://eartharxiv.org/mq2gn)
	* This is a ong-standing project to develop and employ a nitrogen isotope model (δ^15^N) to explain the changes in NH~3~ and NO~3~^-^ isotopes downstream of two wastewater treatment plant discharges. It follows from all the [N~2~O isotope modelling](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090641) we did in the Grand River and the isotopic understandings of [nitrification](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es1002567).
