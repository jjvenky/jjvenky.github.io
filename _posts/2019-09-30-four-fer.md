There is the _two-fer_: where something is [sold](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=two-fer) as 2 for the price of 1,

and there is the _two four_: a case of [beer](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=two-four) with 24 bottles

and the [four-by-four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber#North_American_softwoods): lumber that is actually 3.5" by 3.5",

and the [four-on-the-floor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/four-on-the-floor): [four-speed transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission#"Four_on_the_floor") and [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_on_the_floor_(music)).

And then there is the two week period where four papers are rejected in a row: the _**four-fer**_.
