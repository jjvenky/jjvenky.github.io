There was some [discussion](https://twitter.com/jorgeapenas/status/1186342418779639809) on naming conventions and practices of university-based scientific research groups: do you name the group/lab after the PI or after the field of research. Some surnames are [more amenable](https://twitter.com/JJVenky/status/1186375649080074241) to this [than others](https://twitter.com/JJVenky/status/1186377798673489920) particularly if people don't spell or pronounce them correctly. At some point generic _field lab_ names become either too common or too specific to be useful. How many _ecology labs_ or _biogeochemistry labs_ do we need? Students often rely on the PI for reference letters so branding a group after the PI has some non-egocentric merit.

Logos? Acronyms?

**_What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet_**
