How do we name research groups?

There was some [discussion](https://twitter.com/jorgeapenas/status/1186342418779639809) on naming conventions and practices of university-based scientific research groups: do you name the group/lab after the PI or after the field of research. Some surnames are [more amenable](https://twitter.com/JJVenky/status/1186375649080074241) to this [than others](https://twitter.com/JJVenky/status/1186377798673489920) particularly if people don't spell or pronounce them correctly. At some point generic _field lab_ names become either too common or too specific to be useful. How many _ecology labs_ or _biogeochemistry labs_ do we need? If the research could be done at a variety of universities or institutes then ought one [include that name](https://qe3research.ca/) to be specific?  Students often rely on the PI for reference letters so branding a group after the PI has some non-egocentric merit.

Now, about logos and acronyms â€¦
