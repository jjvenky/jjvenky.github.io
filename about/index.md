I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies at Wilfrid Laurier University. My research is currently focused on the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and related elements, and human and climate related disruptions of these cycles. For more than a decade, I've worked at the worldr-renowned [Experimental Lakes Area](http://www.iisd.org/ela/) studying reservoir creation, ecosystem metabolism and eutrophication. To study the fate of biogeochemical elements, I like to integrates stable isotope measurements with process-based ecological models, like this [one](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=4FQ_rQsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=4FQ_rQsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).
