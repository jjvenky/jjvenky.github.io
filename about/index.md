I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies at [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://wlu.ca/jvenkiteswaran). My research is currently focused on the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and related elements, and human and climate related disruptions of these cycles. For more than a decade, I've worked at the world-renowned [Experimental Lakes Area](http://www.iisd.org/ela/) studying reservoir creation, ecosystem metabolism and eutrophication. To study the fate of biogeochemical elements, I like to integrate stable isotope measurements with process-based ecological models, like this [one](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=4FQ_rQsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=4FQ_rQsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).
