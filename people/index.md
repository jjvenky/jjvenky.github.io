# Current Members

### Jason Venkiteswaran

![](../images/bio-photo.jpg){: class="bio-photo"} 

My research is currently focused on the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and related elements, and human and climate related disruptions of these cycles. For more than a decade,  I have conducted whole-ecosystem research at the world-renowned <a href="https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-arts/faculty-profiles/jason-venkiteswaran/index.html#https://www.iisd.org/ela/">Experimental Lakes Area</a> studying reservoir creation, ecosystem metabolism and eutrophication. To study the fate of biogeochemical elements, I often use stable isotope measurements with process-based ecological models. I am a co-founder of the <a href="https://saveela.org">Coalition to Save ELA</a>.

### Rachel Henderson, MSc student

Rachel completed her BSc in Environmental Science at the University of Waterloo. She is currently studying the role of particulate organic matter in iron uptake and fractionation by cyanobacteria at the Experimental Lakes Area, and how this may differ between eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes. She is interested in the applications of geochemistry to solving environmental problems, and how science can better inform public policy.

### Puru Shah, MSc student

Puru has just finished his undergrad from University of Waterloo in Biochemistry. Through the co-op program, he has worked at Environment and Climate Change Canada researching harmful algal blooms. His thesis work will be looking at algal and cyanobacterial cultures and how they interact with and take up iron to hopefully better understand the role of iron in harmful algal bloom formation.


### JA, MSc student


# Former Members

### BB, BSc student

BB assessed the patterns of land cover diversity at the Experimental Lakes Area.

### Tyler Prentice, BSc student

TP quantified the impacts of freeze-thaw cycles on nutrient release by riparian vegetation. This was a contribution to the multi-university <a href="https://biogeochem.github.io/lugnuts/">luguts</a>, linked undergraduate research in nutrients.


# Friends

Friends are our collaborators at a variety of organizations. In some cases they are co-supervisors, committee members, and/or co-applicants on grants. Often they are co-authors on our papers. In all cases, they are the extended group of people I like to work with. <!-- In alphatical order: Helen Baulch, Nora Casson, Scott Higgins, Lewis Molot, Josh Neufeld, Rebecca North, Michael Paterson, Sherry Schiff, and Colin Whitfield. -->
