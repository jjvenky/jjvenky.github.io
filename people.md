### Jason Venkiteswaran

![image-left](/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg){: .img-bio}

My research is currently focused on the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and related elements, and human and climate related disruptions of these cycles. For more than a decade,  I have conducted whole-ecosystem research at the world-renowned [Experimental Lakes Area](https://www.iisd.org/ela/) studying reservoir creation, ecosystem metabolism and eutrophication. To study the fate of biogeochemical elements, I often use stable isotope measurements with process-based ecological models. I am a co-founder of the [Coalition to Save ELA](https://saveela.org).

### Pieter Aukes, Postdoctoral fellow

![image-left](/assets/images/pieter_aukes-photo.jpg){: .img-bio}

Aukes looks at the variability in natural dissolved organic matter (DOM), with the objective of distinguishing indicators of labile DOM. Liquid Chromatography-Organic Carbon Detection (LC-OCD) uses a size-exclusion method to provide a highly detailed analysis of DOM composition. His research classifies a variety of surface and ground water environments, with the aim to observe differences in composition between environments, as well as to identify components which may indicate the overall lability of DOM in the [SAMMS](http://samms.ca) and [Northern Water Futures](https://researchcentres.wlu.ca/northern-water-futures/index.html) projects.

You can find more information on Aukes' research interests and projects on his [personal website](https://www.pieteraukes.ca).

### Kristin Painter, Postdoctoral fellow

She is excited to return for her MSc, as part of [SAMMS](http://samms.ca), where she will help characterize both terrestrial and aquatic metal deposition histories, stores, and pathways as a result of the mining industry.

### Jeremy Leathers, MSc student

Jeremy completed his Bachelor of Science degree in biology and geography at the University of Winnipeg.  He is looking forward to starting an MSc as a part of [SAMMS](http://samms.ca), where he will help to determine the total organic carbon and arsenic stored within soil and peat within catchments affected by mining activities in the Northwest Territories.

### Catherine Goltz, MSc student

![image-left](/assets/images/catherine_goltz-photo.jpg){: .img-bio}

Catherine completed her BSc (Honours) at the University of Winnipeg looking at how nitrogen influences cyanobacterial blooms and toxins. Her interest in blooms continues in her MSc where she will look at how iron release from sediment can be suppressed to shift algal communities in lakes.

### Matthew Roberts, MSc student

# Former Members

### Megan L. Larsen, Postdoctoral fellow

![image-left](/assets/images/megan_larsen-photo.jpg){: .img-bio}

Megan Larsen is a microbial evolutionary ecologist who has focused on eco-evolutionary feedbacks in microbial communities induced by nutrient stoichiometry. She investigated predictive models for cyanobacterial bloom formation as part of the cross-institutional [FORMBLOOM](https://gwf.usask.ca/formbloom/)) project. Currently, she works with environmental genomics data.

Read more about Larsen's research, professional development for students, and scientific outreach on her [personal webpage](https://meganllarsen.wordpress.com).

### Jared Wolfe, Research associate

![image-left](/assets/images/jared_wolfe-photo.jpg){: .img-bio}

Jared completed his MSc at the University of Regina studying the impacts of Oil Sands industrial development on historical algal communities in northern Saskatchewan. He is currently investigating harmful algal bloom formation and decline in the [Experimental Lakes Area](https://www.iisd.org/ela/) as part of the [FORMBLOOM](https://gwf.usask.ca/formbloom/) project. His interests are in studying relationships between ecosystem components, particularly the relationship between humans and the environment.

### Jordyn Atkins, MSc student

![image-left](/assets/images/jordyn_atkins-photo.jpg){: .img-bio}

In June 2021, Jordyn defended her [MSc thesis](https://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/2383) on how forested catchments and lake residence times control dissolved organic carbon and disinfection by-products at the [Experimental Lakes Area](https://www.iisd.org/ela/). ("Characterizing Boreal Shield Lakes and Catchments to Predict Dissolved Organic Carbon Concentration and Composition in Relation to Safe Drinking Water Sources with Minimal Disinfection By-Products" (2021). Theses and Dissertations (Comprehensive). 2383. [https://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/2383]).

### Puru Shah, MSc student

![image-left](/assets/images/puru_shah-photo.jpg){: .img-bio} 

In March 2021, Puru defended his [MSc thesis](https://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/2374) on algal and cyanobacterial cultures and how they interact with and take up iron to hopefully better understand the role of iron in harmful algal bloom formation. ("Characterization of Micronutrient Dependent Growth by Several Temperate Freshwater Phytoplankton" (2021). Theses and Dissertations (Comprehensive). 2374. [https://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/2374]).

### Rachel Henderson, MSc student

# Friends

Friends are our collaborators at a variety of organizations and institutions. In some cases they are co-supervisors, committee members, and/or co-applicants on grants. Often they are co-authors on our papers. In all cases, they are the extended group of people I like to work with. The model of a single professor with a lab full of students is antiquated and simply not how environmental and biogeochemical research is done. <!-- In alphatical order: Helen Baulch, Nora Casson, Raoul Couture, Scott Higgins, Lewis Molot, Josh Neufeld, Rebecca North, Michael Paterson, Sherry Schiff, and Colin Whitfield. -->
