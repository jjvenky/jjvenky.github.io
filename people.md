### Jason Venkiteswaran

![image-left](/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg){: .img-bio}

My research is currently focused on the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and related elements, and human and climate related disruptions of these cycles. For more than a decade,  I have conducted whole-ecosystem research at the world-renowned [Experimental Lakes Area](https://www.iisd.org/ela/) studying reservoir creation, ecosystem metabolism and eutrophication. To study the fate of biogeochemical elements, I often use stable isotope measurements with process-based ecological models. I am a co-founder of the [Coalition to Save ELA](https://saveela.org).

### Leyden Fernandez, Postdoctoral fellow

Leyden Fernandez is a bioinformatician with expertise in biochemistry and microbiology. Her main research line has focused on multi-omics data analysis, from environmental microbiomes to clinically relevant bacteria. During her PhD studies at Uppsala University, Sweden, she investigated adaptation strategies of non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs in boreal lakes and ponds. She is currently analyzing cyanobacterial genomes to investigate their diversity and evaluate drivers of cyanotoxin production as part of a cross-institutional collaborative [FORMBLOOM](http://formbloom.ca) project.

### Pieter Aukes, Postdoctoral fellow

![image-left](/assets/images/pieter_aukes-photo.jpg){: .img-bio}

Pieter looked at the variability in natural dissolved organic matter (DOM), with the objective of distinguishing indicators of labile DOM. Liquid Chromatography-Organic Carbon Detection (LC-OCD) uses a size-exclusion method to provide a highly detailed analysis of DOM composition. His research classified a variety of arctic and sub-arctic surface and ground water environments, with the aim to observe differences in composition between environments, as well as to identify components which may indicate the overall lability of DOM in the [SAMMS](http://samms.ca) and [Northern Water Futures](https://researchcentres.wlu.ca/northern-water-futures/index.html) projects. He is now a water sciences instructor at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) where he's teaching field techniques and data visualization.

You can find more information on Aukes' projects on his [personal website](https://www.pieteraukes.ca).

### Jared Wolfe, Research associate

# Friends

Friends are our collaborators at a variety of organizations and institutions. In some cases they are co-supervisors, committee members, and/or co-applicants on grants. Often they are co-authors on our papers. In all cases, they are the extended group of people I like to work with. The model of a single professor with a lab full of students is antiquated and simply not how environmental and biogeochemical research is done. <!-- In alphatical order: Helen Baulch, Nora Casson, Raoul Couture, Scott Higgins, Lewis Molot, Josh Neufeld, Rebecca North, Michael Paterson, Sherry Schiff, and Colin Whitfield. -->
