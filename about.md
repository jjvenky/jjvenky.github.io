[I'm](https://wlu.ca/jvenkiteswaran) an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Geography and Environmental Studies](https://wlu.ca/ges) at [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://wlu.ca/jvenkiteswaran). My research is currently focused on the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and related elements, and human and climate related disruptions of these cycles. For more two decades, I've worked at the world-renowned [Experimental Lakes Area](http://www.iisd.org/ela/) studying reservoir creation, ecosystem metabolism and eutrophication. To study the fate of biogeochemical elements, I like to integrate stable isotope measurements with process-based ecological models, like this [one](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=4FQ_rQsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=4FQ_rQsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) and this [one](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JG003065).
