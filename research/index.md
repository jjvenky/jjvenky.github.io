# FORMBLOOM: FORecasting tools and Mitigation options for diverse BLOOM-affected lakes

Freshwater lakes and reservoirs across Canada provide numerous services for local communities ranging from drinking water to recreation. Unfortunately, these same ecosystems are susceptible to a changing climate and nutrient loading. Cyanobacteria, a common photosynthetic group of microbes in freshwater lakes, are known to grow in excess (or bloom) when nutrients loads are high. Under these conditions, cyanobacteria may have detrimental effects on human, animal, and ecosystem health. 

Solving the problem of blooms requires an understanding of how the physical environment links to geochemistry and bloom ecology, and this understanding must exist on the timescale upon which blooms develop and collapse â€“ minutes to hours to weeks. And while solving blooms is a grand challenge, managing their impact is a key interim goal. This project is designed to address key environmental factors that drive bloom onset, duration, and cessation while also evaluting the impact blooms have on ecosystem services.

# Natural Stable Isotopes of Iron: A new tool to trace Fe cycling for management of risk from harmful cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and reservoirs (2016-2020)

Natural stable isotopes of iron contain information about the source of iron required to fuel cyanobacteria blooms. Our recent work has shown the importance of reduced iron to cyanobacteria [in embayments along Georgian bay](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0377) in support of our [conceptual model](https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12334) that links anoxia, phosphorus, nitrogen , iron, and sulphate to cyanobacteria blooms. Following the surprising results in our [2018 paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46708) that showed intriguing patterns between the a) terrestrial and lake surface waters, b) between dissolved and particulate pahses throughout the lake waer column, and c) between the lake surface and bottom, we are employing iron (and carbon and nitrogen) isotopes to look at the relative importance and timing of Fe sources and processes in Canadian shield lakes.
